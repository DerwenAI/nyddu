## TODO list:

  * integrate Selenium-based scraper for failover, as post-processing
  * use `Page.id` for per-page detail

  * annotate/show the broken links
  * align the titles, keywords, descriptions
  * autocomplete / free-text search of titles and descriptions
  * extend base classes with custom classes / custom schema?
